# jsclasses

Japanese classes written by Haruhiko Okumura (okumura@okumuralab.org).
jsarticle, jsbook, and jspf classes are provided. In addition, several
style files are provided, too.

The classes themselves do not automatically enable the support of
Japanese language. You'll need to set up LaTeX environment appropriately
so that it can handle Japanese, not only LaTeX itself but also viewers
of outputs.

We include the pre-generated cls/sty files in this package to ensure
proper encoding. The files have to be in ISO-2022-JP encoding to work
properly on Windows. These files can be generated in a Japanese locale
by running platex on the .dtx files.
